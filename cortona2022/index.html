    <h2>Overview</h2>
    
    <p>
      Homotopy Type Theory and Univalent Mathematics are emerging fields of mathematics that study
      a fruitful relationship between homotopy theory and (dependent) type
      theory. 
      This relation plays a crucial role in Voevodsky's program of Univalent
      Foundations, a new approach to foundations of mathematics, based on
      ideas from homotopy theory, such as the Univalence Principle.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <a href="https://github.com/UniMath/UniMath">UniMath library</a> 
      is a large repository of computer-checked
      mathematics, developed from the univalent viewpoint. 
      It is freely available for everyone, as an open-source project,
      <a href="https://github.com/UniMath/UniMath">from the web</a>.
      The School will
      give many young researchers an opportunity to familiarize themselves
      with the UniMath library and become contributors.
    </p>


    
    <h2>Format</h2>

    <p>
    Participants will receive an introduction to 
    Univalent Foundations and to Mathematics in those foundations, by leading experts in the field.
    In the accompanying problem sessions, participants will formalize pieces of Univalent Mathematics in the 
      UniMath library.
    </p>

    <h2>Social</h2>

    Please join our <a href="https://unimath.zulipchat.com/register/">Zulip server</a> for discussion before, during, and after the school.

    
    <h2>Schedule</h2>

    <ul>
      <li> UniMath install party planned for the afternoon of Sunday 17 July 2022. </li>
      <li> School Monday 18 July - Friday 22 July 2022.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Lecture material</h2>

    See the <a href="https://unimath.github.io/Schools/">UniMath/Schools Github repository</a>.
    

    <h2>Before the event</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>Check recommended reading
      <li>Install UniMath on your laptop
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Recommended reading</h3>
    You can prepare for the school by studying some of the material listed below.
    
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://hal.inria.fr/inria-00001173v6/document">Coq in a hurry (by Yves Bertot)</a> An introduction to vanilla Coq. It does not cover the univalent point of view, but gives a gentle introduction to Coq, the underlying proof assistant of UniMath.
      <li><a href="https://www.lri.fr/~paulin/LASER/course-notes.pdf">Introduction to the Coq proof-assistant for practical software verification (by Christine Paulin-Mohring)</a> Another introduction with Coq, including screenshots. It is a bit outdated, but might still be useful.
      <li><a href="https://homotopytypetheory.org/book/">HoTT book</a> Comprehensive overview of univalent foundations. 
      <li><a href="https://faculty.math.illinois.edu/~dan/Papers/ium.pdf">An introduction to univalent foundations for mathematicians (by Dan Grayson)</a> An gentle introduction to univalent foundations.
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Installing UniMath</h3>
    
    Please install <a href="https://github.com/UniMath/UniMath">UniMath</a> on your laptop before coming to Cortona.
    To this end, read the <a href="https://github.com/UniMath/UniMath/blob/master/INSTALL.md">installation instructions</a>.
    In case of problems or questions, contact the <a href="mailto:univalent-mathematics@googlegroups.com">UniMath mailing list</a>.
    
    You can also attend the UniMath install party on Sunday afternoon for help with the installation - see Section "Schedule" for more information.
