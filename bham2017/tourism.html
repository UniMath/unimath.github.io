</ul>


<h3>JEWELLERY QUARTER</h3>

Walk around the area that used to contain loads of jewellery factories
and still contains plenty of jewellery shops.  Admire the intricacy
of the Victorian red brickwork, even on simple utilitarian buildings.

St Paul's church is very nice.  It's regarded as part of the JQ
but is a bit out of it.  It is close to the restaurant for Thursday
evening's meal, so maybe go there before that.

The cemetary contains the grave of typographer William Baskerville.

There is also a museum.
