    <h1>School and Workshop on Univalent Mathematics</h1>
    <h2>sponsored by the John Templeton Foundation</h2>
    <p>December 11-15, 2017, University of Birmingham, United Kingdom</p>


    <h2>Overview</h2>
    
    <p>
      Univalent Type Theory is an emerging field of mathematics that studies
      a fruitful relationship between homotopy theory and (dependent) type
      theory. 
      This relation plays a crucial role in Voevodsky's program of Univalent
      Foundations, a new approach to foundations of mathematics, based on
      ideas from homotopy theory, such as the Univalence Principle.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <a href="https://github.com/UniMath/UniMath">UniMath library</a> 
      is a large repository of computer-checked
      mathematics, developed from the univalent viewpoint. 
      It is freely available for everyone, as an open-source project,
      <a href="https://github.com/UniMath/UniMath">from the web</a>.
      The workshop will
      give many young researchers an opportunity to familiarize themselves
      with the UniMath library and become contributors.
    </p>


    
    <h2>Format</h2>

    During the school/workshop, the participants will be working either
    individually or in small groups, mentored by experienced UniMath
    developers. The problems will be designed to be of practical
    importance in the development of the UniMath library as well as of
    pedagogical value to participants.
