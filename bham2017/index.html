    <h1>School and Workshop on Univalent Mathematics</h1>
    <h2>sponsored by the John Templeton Foundation</h2>
    <p>December 11-15, 2017, University of Birmingham, United Kingdom</p>


    <h2>Overview</h2>
    
    <p>
      Univalent Type Theory is an emerging field of mathematics that studies
      a fruitful relationship between homotopy theory and (dependent) type
      theory. 
      This relation plays a crucial role in Voevodsky's program of Univalent
      Foundations, a new approach to foundations of mathematics, based on
      ideas from homotopy theory, such as the Univalence Principle.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <a href="https://github.com/UniMath/UniMath">UniMath library</a> 
      is a large repository of computer-checked
      mathematics, developed from the univalent viewpoint. 
      It is freely available for everyone, as an open-source project,
      <a href="https://github.com/UniMath/UniMath">from the web</a>.
      The workshop will
      give many young researchers an opportunity to familiarize themselves
      with the UniMath library and become contributors.
    </p>


    
    <h2>Format</h2>

    During the school/workshop, the participants will be working either
    individually or in small groups, mentored by experienced UniMath
    developers. The problems will be designed to be of practical
    importance in the development of the UniMath library as well as of
    pedagogical value to participants.

    <h2>Location</h2>
    
    The school/workshop takes place at the University of Birmingham, UK.
    The address is <b>Learning Center, Birmingham B15 2FG, UK</b>.
    The map below indicates the walking path from the nearby train station 'University' to 
    the Learning Center.

    <h2>Schedule</h2>
    

    The following is a rough schedule, to be refined in the near future.
    Important: Wednesday afternoon is off. Also, the lab session on Friday afternoon should be considered optional, 
    so participants can travel home after lunch.

    <h2>Accommodation</h2>
    
    We ask participants to arrange their own accommodation.
    Below we give some information and list a few hotels - you might use
    a search engine or hotel booking website to find others.
    
    <p>
      The school/workshop takes place at the University of Birmingham, located at Edgbaston, Birmingham.
      We recommend choosing accommodation in the city centre of Birmingham, and taking the train to
      University. The train ride from the city centre train station, called New Street, to 
      the University station (see section Location) takes about 10 minutes, and trains run very frequently.
      A return ticket is GBP 3.
    </p>
    <p>
      The New Street train station is in the newly renovated Grand Central, which besides the station features many restaurants and shops,
      and which is not run-down as one might expect a train station to be.
      Birmingham city centre is lively and features many restaurants.
    </p>

    You can start your search using this <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/maps/search/hotel+near+Grand+Central,+Birmingham">Google Maps search link</a>.
    We have personal experience only with the following hotel:
    <ul>
      <li> <a href="http://www.premierinn.com/gb/en/hotels/england/west-midlands/birmingham/birmingham-city-centre-new-st-station.html">Premier Inn Birmingham City Centre New St Station</a>: directly next to New Street train station, not very beautiful but modern and functional. Breakfast not included. The free wifi requires frequent re-logins, better wifi available at extra cost.
    </ul>
    
    The area around the University campus accommodates mostly students and might, accordingly, be less calm or well-maintained than desired.
    We advise against booking accommodation there.


    <h2>Before the event</h2>
    
    You can prepare for the school by studying some of the material listed below.
    
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://hal.inria.fr/inria-00001173v6/document">Coq in a hurry (by Yves Bertot)</a> An introduction to vanilla Coq. It does not cover the univalent point of view, but gives a gentle introduction to Coq, the underlying proof assistant of UniMath.
      <li><a href="https://www.lri.fr/~paulin/LASER/course-notes.pdf">Introduction to the Coq proof-assistant for practical software verification (by Christine Paulin-Mohring)</a> Another introduction with Coq, including screenshots. It is a bit outdated, but might still be useful.
      <li><a href="https://homotopytypetheory.org/book/">HoTT book</a> Comprehensive overview of univalent foundations. 
    </ul>
