    <h1>School and Workshop on Univalent Type Theory</h1>
    <p>December 11-15, 2017, Birmingham, United Kingdom.</p>


    <h2>Overview</h2>
    
    <p>
      Univalent Type Theory is an emerging field of mathematics that studies a fruitful relationship between homotopy theory and (dependent) type theory. In its origins, homotopy theory is a branch of topology, concerned with certain invariants of topological spaces and their generalizations. Type theory is a branch of mathematical logic exploring a class of formal systems arising from the theory of (programming) languages. These systems provide an alternative logical foundation of mathematics, a foundation amenable to the use in computer proof checkers for the mechanical verification of mathematical proofs. Studying the relation between homotopy theory and type theory has recently led to groundbreaking results, in particular, Voevodsky's Univalence Principle. This principle, shown by Voevodsky to hold in the simplicial set model of type theory, has proved extremely valuable in the practical formalization of mathematics.
    </p>
    <p>
      Univalent Foundations are new foundations of mathematics inspired by Voevodsky's simplicial set model. In Univalent Foundations, the basic objects are (higher) groupoids. Those groupoids are stratified according to their homotopy level, and propositions and sets, respectively, are those groupoids of homotopy level 1 and 2, respectively. The classification of (types of) mathematical objects according to their homotopy level is the most fundamental principle of Univalent Foundations.
    </p>
    <p>
      The UniMath project aims to provide a substantial library of computer-checked mathematics, organized from the univalent viewpoint. The project was founded in 2013 by Fields medalist Vladimir Voevodsky, Benedikt Ahrens, and Daniel Grayson. Since then, UniMath has grown substantially in both size as well as areas of mathematics and computer science covered. Overall, 13 contributors have created a library of more than 100,000 lines of computer-checked results.

    <h2>Format</h2>

    The proposed event will consist of two components:
    <ul>
      <li> A workshop, during which experts in the field will present their recent research to other experts and newcomers in the field.</li>
      <li>A school, during which the experts will mentor the newcomers through small individual projects, designed to be both of practical use for the development of the UniMath library and of pedagogical value to the newcomer.</li>
    </ul>
    As such, we hope that the workshop will provide a forum to present and develop new results in the field, while also bringing new researchers, especially students, to the area.
