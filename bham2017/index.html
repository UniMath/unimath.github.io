    <h1>School and Workshop on Univalent Mathematics</h1>
    <p>December 11-15, 2017, Birmingham, United Kingdom.</p>


    <h2>Overview</h2>
    
    <p>
      Univalent Type Theory is an emerging field of mathematics that studies
      a fruitful relationship between homotopy theory and (dependent) type
      theory. This relation has led to Voevodsky's program of Univalent
      Foundations, a new approach to foundations of mathematics, based on
      ideas from homotopy theory, such as the Univalence Principle.
    </p>
    <p>
      The UniMath library is a large repository of computer-checked
      mathematics, developed from the univalent viewpoint. The workshop will
      give many young researchers an opportunity to familiarize themselves
      with the UniMath library and become contributors.
    </p>


    
    <h2>Format</h2>

    During the school/workshop, the participants will be working either
    individually or in small groups, mentored by some of the UniMath lead
    developers. The problems will be designed to be of practical
    importance in the development of the UniMath library as well as of
    pedagogical value to participants.
