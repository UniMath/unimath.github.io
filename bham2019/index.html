    <h1>School and Workshop on Univalent Mathematics</h1>

    <h2>Overview</h2>
    
    <p>
      Univalent Type Theory is an emerging field of mathematics that studies
      a fruitful relationship between homotopy theory and (dependent) type
      theory. 
      This relation plays a crucial role in Voevodsky's program of Univalent
      Foundations, a new approach to foundations of mathematics, based on
      ideas from homotopy theory, such as the Univalence Principle.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <a href="https://github.com/UniMath/UniMath">UniMath library</a> 
      is a large repository of computer-checked
      mathematics, developed from the univalent viewpoint. 
      It is freely available for everyone, as an open-source project,
      <a href="https://github.com/UniMath/UniMath">from the web</a>.
      The workshop will
      give many young researchers an opportunity to familiarize themselves
      with the UniMath library and become contributors.
    </p>


    
    <h2>Format</h2>

    We will have two tracks:
    <ul>
      <li>Beginners track</li>
      <li>Advanced track: suitable for participants with some experience in Univalent Foundations and the proof assistant Coq.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
    In the beginners track, you will receive an introduction to 
    Univalent Foundations and to mathematics in those foundations, by leading experts in the field.
    In the accompanying problem sessions, you will formalize pieces of univalent mathematics in the 
      UniMath library.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the advanced track, you will work, in a small group, on formalizing a specific topic in UniMath, 
      guided by an expert in univalent mathematics.
      Your code will become part of the UniMath library.
    </p>

    <h2>Lecture material</h2>

    Coming later...



    
    <h2>Mentors</h2>
    
    <ul>
      <li>Benedikt Ahrens (University of Birmingham)</li>
      <li>Thorsten Altenkirch (University of Nottingham)</li>
      <li>Andrej Bauer (University of Ljubljana)</li>
      <li>Auke Booij (University of Birmingham)</li>
      <li>Martín Escardó (University of Birmingham)</li>
      <li>Tom de Jong (University of Birmingham)</li>
      <li>Marco Maggesi (University of Florence)</li>
      <li>Ralph Matthes (CNRS, University Toulouse)</li>
      <li>Anders Mörtberg (Carnegie Mellon University and University of Gothenburg)</li>
      <li>Niels van der Weide (University of Nijmegen)</li>
      <li>...</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Accommodation</h2>
    
    We ask participants to arrange their own accommodation.


    <!--
    <h2>Transportation</h2>
 

    <p>
      The train ride from the city centre train station, called New Street, to 
      the University station (see section Location) takes about 10 minutes, and trains run very frequently (usually from platform 12).
      A return ticket is GBP 3. Be aware that there are "Anytime" (GBP 3) and "Off-Peak" (GBP 2.60) return tickets; the latter do not allow travel
      from New Street to University before 9:30am.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you commute by train (e.g., from the city centre), weekly tickets are available.
      They are available only at a counter, not at the ticket machines, and require a photograph.
      A weekly ticket between New Street and University costs GBP 11.20 (compared to GBP 15 for 5 return tickets).
    </p>
    <p>Buses in Birmingham give no change!
      The single fare is GBP 2.40 and the "day saver" is GBP 4.
      This gets you on any National
      Express bus (but not the independent companies) in the West Midlands.
    </p>

    <h2>Before the event</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>Check recommended reading
      <li>Install UniMath on your laptop
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Recommended reading</h3>
    You can prepare for the school by studying some of the material listed below.
    
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://hal.inria.fr/inria-00001173v6/document">Coq in a hurry (by Yves Bertot)</a> An introduction to vanilla Coq. It does not cover the univalent point of view, but gives a gentle introduction to Coq, the underlying proof assistant of UniMath.
      <li><a href="https://www.lri.fr/~paulin/LASER/course-notes.pdf">Introduction to the Coq proof-assistant for practical software verification (by Christine Paulin-Mohring)</a> Another introduction with Coq, including screenshots. It is a bit outdated, but might still be useful.
      <li><a href="https://homotopytypetheory.org/book/">HoTT book</a> Comprehensive overview of univalent foundations. 
      <li><a href="https://faculty.math.illinois.edu/~dan/Papers/ium.pdf">An introduction to univalent foundations for mathematicians (by Dan Grayson)</a> An gentle introduction to univalent foundations.
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Installing UniMath</h3>
