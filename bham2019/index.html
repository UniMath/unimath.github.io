    <h1>School and Workshop on Univalent Mathematics</h1>
    <h2>organised under the auspices of <a href="https://eutypes.cs.ru.nl/">COST Action CA15123 EUTypes</a></h2>
    <p>April 01-05, 2019, University of Birmingham, United Kingdom</p>

    
    
    <h2>Emergency contact information</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>For any emergency, call 999 or, equivalently, 112. The operator will route you to police, ambulance, or fire brigade as necessary.
      <li>In less serious cases, Benedikt Ahrens can be reached on <a href="tel:+447482799962">+44 7482 799962</a> or by <a href="mailto:B.Ahrens@cs.bham.ac.uk">email</a>.
    </ul>
    
    
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    
    <p>
      Univalent Type Theory is an emerging field of mathematics that studies
      a fruitful relationship between homotopy theory and (dependent) type
      theory. 
      This relation plays a crucial role in Voevodsky's program of Univalent
      Foundations, a new approach to foundations of mathematics, based on
      ideas from homotopy theory, such as the Univalence Principle.
    </p>
    <p>
      The <a href="https://github.com/UniMath/UniMath">UniMath library</a> 
      is a large repository of computer-checked
      mathematics, developed from the univalent viewpoint. 
      It is freely available for everyone, as an open-source project,
      <a href="https://github.com/UniMath/UniMath">from the web</a>.
      The workshop will
      give many young researchers an opportunity to familiarize themselves
      with the UniMath library and become contributors.
    </p>


    
    <h2>Format</h2>

    We will have two tracks:
    <ul>
      <li>Beginners track</li>
      <li>Advanced track: suitable for participants with some experience in Univalent Foundations and the proof assistant Coq.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
    In the beginners track, you will receive an introduction to 
    Univalent Foundations and to mathematics in those foundations, by leading experts in the field.
    In the accompanying problem sessions, you will formalize pieces of univalent mathematics in the 
      UniMath library.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the advanced track, you will work, in a small group, on formalizing a specific topic in UniMath, 
      guided by an expert in univalent mathematics.
      Your code will become part of the UniMath library.
    </p>

    <h2>Location</h2>
    
    The school/workshop takes place at the University of Birmingham, UK.
    The address is <b>Learning Centre, Birmingham B15 2FG, UK</b>.
    The map below indicates the walking path from the nearby train station 'University' to 
    the Learning Center.

    </p>

    <h3>Transportation</h3>
 

    <p>
      The train ride from the city centre train station, called New Street, to 
      the University station (see section Location) takes about 10 minutes, and trains run very frequently (usually from platform 12).
      A return ticket is GBP 3.20 if you travel to University before 9:30 ("Anytime" ticket) and GBP 2.70 if you travel to University after 9:30 ("Off-peak" ticket).
    </p>
    <p>
      If you commute by train (e.g., from the city centre), weekly tickets are available.
      They are available only at a counter, not at the ticket machines, and require a photograph.
      A weekly ticket between New Street and University costs about GBP 12.
    </p>
    <p>If you require a bus instead, see 
      <a href="https://nxbus.co.uk/west-midlands/">National Express West Midlands</a>.
      Be aware that buses in Birmingham give no change!
    </p>

    
    <h3>Internet access</h3>

    <ul>
      <li> <b>Eduroam</b> is available on the campus.
      <li>If you do not have access to Eduroam, you can connect to <b>WiFiGuest</b> - you will need to fill out a web form to connect to the internet.
